# Doom Vanille
Linux Doom ported to DOS. Aims at 100% compatibility with the original Final Doom (id Anthology) executable, but will still work fine with the shareware, registed and retail (Ultimate) versions of Doom. 

## Supported games
* Doom Shareware
* Doom Registered
* The Ultimate Doom
* Doom II: Hell on Earth
* TNT: Evilution
* The Plutonia Experiment

You can see the supported IWAD names [here](https://github.com/AXDOOMER/doom-vanille/wiki/Supported-IWADs).

If you have multiple IWADs in your directory, you can use the `-iwad` parameter to specify which IWAD to use.
